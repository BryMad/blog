# A Blog Starter App

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app done as a project in a class.

Working from Dr. Toal's starter code I have added:

- edit functionality
- delete functionality
- a way to cancel out of "new article" creation (that's kind of janky, but still learning here!)
- improve date display for articles
- CSS styling
